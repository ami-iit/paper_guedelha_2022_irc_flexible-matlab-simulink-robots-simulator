## Analysing the Simulation Speed Improvement

The first set of experiments aims at illustrating the simulation speed improvement resulting from the introduction of the Simulink Functions.
This relates to Sections III - A & B of the paper.

The dynamics computation functions in the class `Robot` targeted for the performance analysis are the following:
- `get_mass_matrix` computes the robot inertial matrix
- `get_bias_forces` computes the generalised bias forces,
- `get_feet_jacobians` computes the feet frames Jacobians,
- `get_feet_JDot_nu` computes the feet bias accelerations,
- `get_feet_H` computes the feet frames transformations.

For measuring the performance weâ€™ve used two profilers, the MATLAB profiler which tracks the execution of all MATLAB interpreted code, and the Simulink profiler which tracks the execution of the Simulink blocks and the code produced by the Simulink code generator. During each performance analysis (before and after the code optimisation introducing the Simulink functions), we run both profilers for accounting for their impact on the performance and for covering all the running code.

### Running the Simulation and Profilers

We describe in this section the steps to follow in the MATLAB/Simulink environment in order to run the simulation and profilers, export the profilers output data to the workspace as `.mat` files[^1], then run the [`loadTimeSeries.m`](./scripts/loadTimeSeries.m) script for evaluating the execution times of the dynamics computation functions and generating the performance comparison plot. For the simulator general usage instructions, refer to the docmentation in https://github.com/ami-iit/matlab-whole-body-simulator/blob/master/README.md#runner-how-to-use-the-simulator.

In the steps below we assume you have followed and completed the steps in the [One Line Installation](../README.md#floppy_disk-one-line-installation) steps of the main README.

[^1]: Stored in the folder [data](./data).


1. In a terminal, go to the directory where you cloned the repository `matlab-whole-body-simulator`and checkout the commit depending on the simulator version you wish to profile:
    - profiling before the optimisation: use commit 6af23d0d11d3b3153a374d649ce91535104eeb6f.
    - profiling after the optimisation: use commit 266512a87b6a5bcf438744463855ecbd290d520d.

1. In the MATLAB command line change the current folder to that same directory.

1. Select the robot model to `iCubGenova04` by setting the environment variable `YARP_ROBOT_NAME`: `setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','iCubGenova04')`

1. Leave the default configuration parameters `robot_config`, `contact_config` and `physics_config` defined in the `./app/robots/iCubGenova04/configRobot.m` file.

1. In the main config initialisation file `./init.m`:
    - set `Config.simulationTime` to `1` (second),
    - profiling before the optimisation: set `Config.USE_OSQP` to `false` (the MATLAB solver `quadprog` shall be used),
    - profiling after the optimisation: set `Config.USE_OSQP` to `false`, `Config.USE_QPOASES` to `true` (the qpOASES[^2] solver shall be used).

1. In this short simulation, we are feeding null torques to the iCub robot model, so you can leave the parameter "input motor reflected inertia format" set to `vector`.

1. Open the model `./test_matlab_system.mdl`.

1. Run the MATLAB profiler from the command line:
    - launch the profiler app window which also displays profiling results and the Flame graph: `profile viewer`,
    - start the profiler from the command line: `profile on`.

1. Run the Simulink profiler and model From the Simulink window:
    - select the "Debug" tab on the Toolstrip,
    - click the "Performance Advisor" drop-down and select "Simulink Profiler", this opens a new tab "PROFILE",
    - in that same tab, hit the "Profile" button to run the model with profiling enabled.

1. The Simulink profiler stops automatically after the simulation ends.

1. Export and save the Simulink profiler results into a `<filename>.mat` file by clicking "Export to MAT" in the "PROFILE" tab. This saves the data into a variable `profilerData` in the MAT file.

1. Stop the MATLAB profiler: `profilerData_interpreter = profile('info')`. This also imports the profiler results[^3] into a new variable `profilerData_interpreter` created in the workspace.

1. Save the imported results into the same `<filename>.mat` file created by the Simulink profiler in previous steps: `save("<filename>.mat","profilerData_interpreter","-append")`. It is crucial to use the `-append` option for not overwriting the profiler data stored in the previous steps.

1. For running again the simulation generating new profiling results, do:
    - turn on again the MATLAB profiler (`profile on`) and hit again the "Profile" button in the "PROFILE" tab from the Simulink window.
    - after the simulation ends along with the Simulink profiler, stop the MATLAB profiler and export both profilers data to a new MAT file as described previously.
    
    Generate and save a new profile result as many times as desired, with the simulator version before the optimisation and the version after the optimisation. Figure 3 bar graph in the paper was generated from all six reports in the folders [`<reporoot>/data/profilerResults_before_optim`](./data/profilerResults_before_optim) and [`<reporoot>/data/profilerResults_after_optim`](./data/profilerResults_after_optim). Profile result file names always follow the pattern `test_matlab_system_*.mat`. If you change that pattern or folder name, remember to reflect it in the script [`<reporoot>/scripts/loadTimeSeries.m`](./scripts/loadTimeSeries.m).

1. Run the script [`<reporoot>/scripts/loadTimeSeries.m`](./scripts/loadTimeSeries.m) for generating and plotting the targeted functions execution times.

[^3]: The generated report in the GUI window provides the number of calls, the self time (which excludes child functions execution time) and the total time. The same data is accessible through the imported results.

### On the Profilers and Profiling Script

It is relevant to highlight the Simulink blocks and MATLAB functions call tree: the most outer Simulink block `RobotDynWithContacts` wraps the MATLAB System block `step_block` implemented by the respective class. The latter defines methods `setupImpl` and `stepImpl` which respectively instantiate the class `Robot` and call its dynamics computation functions that we wish to track, namely `get_mass_matrix`, `get_bias_forces`, `get_feet_jacobians`, `get_feet_JDot_nu` and `get_feet_H`. Before the code optimisation, these functions run a cascade of wrapper functions that call MEX functions built with C Matrix API, and which implement the respective iDynTree library dynamics algorithms. Instead, after the code optimisation, these functions call special methods in the class `Robot` called "Simulink Functions" which trigger programmatically Simulink blocks implementing the equivalent computations.

#### Profiling before the Code Optimisation

The Simulink profiler tracks the total execution times of the most outer Simulink block `RobotDynWithContacts` and the MATLAB System block `step_block` within, which total execution time matches the total execution time of `stepImpl`, that of `setupImpl` being negligible.

The MATLAB profiler tracks the execution of all MATLAB interpreted code called from `stepImpl`, including the class `Robot` dynamics computation functions mentioned earlier.

Having in mind the profilers behaviour described above, we proceed as follows:
- **Tracking the outer Simulink block `RobotDynWithContacts`:** We use the Simulink profiler tracking results from `profilerData.rootUINode.children(1).totalTime`.
- **Tracking the MATLAB System block `step_block`:** We could arbitrarily use either MATLAB or Simulink profilers results (respectively the method `setupImpl` result from the table `profilerData_interpreter.FunctionTable` or the MATLAB System block `step_block` result from the single element array `profilerData.rootUINode.children(1).children`). Nevertheless, the MATLAB profiler cannot track the code produced by the Simulink code generator after the code optimisation, thus, for comparing results produced by the same profiler, we chose the Simulink profiler result `profilerData.rootUINode.children(1).children.totalTime`.
- **Tracking the `Robot` class methods `get_mass_matrix`, `get_bias_forces`, `get_feet_jacobians`, `get_feet_JDot_nu` and `get_feet_H`:** We use the MATLAB profiler tracking results from the array `profilerData_interpreter.FunctionTable`. each element of the array has a function name `FunctionName` matching the respective method from the class `Robot`, and a `TotalTime` execution time in seconds.

#### Profiling after the Code Optimisation:

The Simulink profiler tracks the total execution times of the most outer Simulink block `RobotDynWithContacts`, the MATLAB System block `step_block` within and the Simulink functions triggered programmatically from the dynamics computation functions in the class `Robot`.

The MATLAB profiler cannot track the code produced by the Simulink code generator, so we can count only on the Simulink profiler output for the targeted functions.

Having in mind the profilers behaviour described above, we proceed as follows:
- **Tracking the outer Simulink block `RobotDynWithContacts`:** We use the Simulink profiler tracking results from `profilerData.rootUINode.children(1).totalTime` as previously.
- **Tracking the MATLAB System block `step_block`:** We use the Simulink profiler tracking results from `profilerData.rootUINode.children(1).children(1)`.
- **Tracking the `Robot` class methods `get_mass_matrix`, `get_bias_forces`, `get_feet_jacobians`, `get_feet_JDot_nu` and `get_feet_H`:** We use the Simulink profiler tracking results from the array `profilerData.rootUINode.children(1).children`. The array has no function names which we could use to directly match the respective method from the class `Robot`. Instead we used hardcoded indexes (refer to table `matlabProfilerFunctionNames`, column `funcIndex` in the `loadTimeSeries.m` script). 


#### Note
As the MATLAB profiler slows down the simulation by a factor of 1.48 when monitoring the non optimised model, while having no impact on the modelwhich uses Simulink functions, we apply the respective correction factor to the MATLAB profiler tracking results (refer to `matlabProfilerPenaltyComp` in the `loadTimeSeries.m` script).
